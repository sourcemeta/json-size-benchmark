He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a "length-limited" conversation!hlocation•gaddressp2712 Broadway StjpostalCodehCA 94115dcitymSan FranciscokcountryCodebUSfregionjCaliforniahprofilesÇ£gnetworkgTwitterhusernameoneutralthoughtscurl`£gnetworkjSoundCloudhusernameldandymusicnlcurlx#https://soundcloud.com/dandymusicnldworkÅßgcompanyjPied PiperhpositionmCEO/Presidentgwebsitethttp://piedpiper.comistartDatej2013-12-01gendDatej2014-12-01gsummaryxÔPied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has consistently fielded high Weisman Scores that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoretical limit of lossless compression.jhighlightsÉxaBuild an algorithm for artist to detect if their music was violating copy right infringement lawsx#Successfully won Techcrunch DisruptxMOptimized an algorithm that holds the current world record for Weisman ScoresivolunteerÅßlorganizationiCoderDojohpositiongTeachergwebsiteuhttp://coderdojo.com/istartDatej2012-01-01gendDatej2013-01-01gsummaryx6Global movement of free coding clubs for young people.jhighlightsÅxAwarded 'Teacher of the Month'ieducationÅßkinstitutionvUniversity of OklahomadareavInformation TechnologyistudyTypehBacheloristartDatej2011-06-01gendDatej2014-01-01cgpac4.0gcoursesÇrDB1101 - Basic SQLxCS2011 - Java IntroductionfawardsÅ§etitlex!Digital Compression Pioneer Awardddatej2014-11-01gawarderjTechcrunchgsummaryrThere is no spoon.lpublicationsÅ•dnamexVideo compression for 3d mediaipublishereHoolikreleaseDatej2014-10-01gwebsitex7http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)gsummaryxOInnovative middle-out compression algorithm that changes the way we store data.fskillsÇ£dnameoWeb DevelopmentelevelfMasterhkeywordsÉdHTMLcCSSjJavascript£dnamekCompressionelevelfMasterhkeywordsÉdMpegcMP4cGIFilanguagesÅ¢hlanguagegEnglishgfluencynNative speakeriinterestsÅ¢dnamehWildlifehkeywordsÇgFerretshUnicornsjreferencesÅ¢dnamenErlich BachmanireferencexüIt is my pleasure to recommend Richard, his performance working as a consultant for Main St. Company proved that he will be a valuable addition to any company.
